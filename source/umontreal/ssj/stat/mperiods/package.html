Provides facilities for storing observations during a simulation
per time period, for the common situation where time is partitioned
into a finite number of intervals, and statistics have to be collected
separately for the different intervals.
For example, we may want to collect statistics on the quality of service
for each hour in a telephone call center.

Sometimes, a vector or a matrix of statistical probes is sufficient for
performing this task, especially when simulating independent
replications.  Probes are used during an experiment to compute
sums and the resulting sums or averages are collected in tallies
to get samples; the sample size corresponds to the
number of replications.  However, the number of periods can sometimes
be random.% while the size of an array or matrix of probes cannot change.
This happens when using the batch means method \cite{sLAW00a},
if the number of batches can change adaptively.
For the same reason, it can be necessary to regroup periods to save
memory, when the total number of periods becomes too large; this is
not supported by a matrix of statistical probes.
Events can also be counted in previous batches in addition to the last
one.  As a result, in a general setting, a probe computing a sum and
being reset at the end of each batch cannot be used.

When the number of periods is large, it can be necessary to get
observations for a subset of these periods, e.g., the last ten
periods.  For example, this can be used by the dialer of a phone call
center to determine the quality of service in the last ten minutes on
which decisions can be based.

To address these problems, this package defines an interface for a
matrix of measures.  Each row of this matrix corresponds to a type of
event, e.g., the type of a customer in a retail store.  Each column
corresponds to a period that can be any time interval such as half an
hour, a complete day, etc.

When independent replications of the same simulation are performed, the
finite horizon is often divided into periods.
For each period, a vector of observations may be
computed and stored.  This results in a matrix of observations that
can be added to a matrix of tallies at the end of each
replication.  The matrix can be obtained from the vectors of
observations directly, or some vectors can be regrouped.

When simulating for an infinite horizon, a single vector of
observations may be obtained.  However, to get an estimate on the
variance, for computing confidence intervals, the simulation time is
divided into intervals called batches.  For each batch, a vector of
observations is obtained.  If the simulation length is constant, or if
the number of batches is allowed to be random, it is sufficient to
compute one vector at a time and collect it as observations at the end of
each batch.  However, when the number of batches is required to be
constant while the simulation length is random, it is necessary to
keep all the vectors of observations to regroup them later. Vectors of
observations, or groups of vectors, are collected during or at the end
of the simulation.

Depending on the type of experiment, matrices of measures can be added
directly to tallies as matrices of observations, some columns can be
regrouped, or each column (or group of consecutive columns) might be
collected in tallies separately.
This package provides a mechanism to implement simulation events
collecting independently of the way the experiment is performed.
The {@link umontreal.iro.lecuyer.stat.mperiods.MeasureMatrix}
interface represents a matrix of measures.  Usually, an implementation
of this
interface counts the number of occurrences of an event, the sum of
values, or some integrals.  The {@link
umontreal.iro.lecuyer.stat.mperiods.SumMatrix} class implements this
interface for computing a matrix of sums.  A subclass, {@link
umontreal.iro.lecuyer.stat.mperiods.SumMatrixSW}, provides a sliding
window permitting the observations in a subset of the periods to be
stored.   For integrals, the
simulator must provide a custom implementation of {@link
umontreal.iro.lecuyer.stat.mperiods.MeasureMatrix} which computes a
function relative to the simulation time, from time~0 to the current
simulation time.
The {@link umontreal.iro.lecuyer.stat.mperiods.IntegralMeasureMatrix}
class can be used to get the value of the integral for time intervals by
storing the value of the integral for user-defined times.
