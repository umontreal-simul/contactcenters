Extends the JAXB framework with new classes to simplify
the process of marshalling and unmarshalling objects with
validation using XML Schema.
The JAXB framework, implemented
in package
{@link javax.xml.bind}, can be used to map elements of
an XML document to Java objects.
The binding compiler \texttt{xjc}
is used to derive Java classes from a XML Schema,
and the JAXB runtime to unmarshal XML contents into Java objects,
or marshal objects back to XML.

JAXB-derived classes do not contain any behavior; these are simple
data classes.
As a result, work is often required to transform objects from these
derived classes into other more useful objects.
For example, an helper method is necessary to turn objects containing
parameters for a random variate generator into a true generator
with an associated implementation generating numbers.
This package defines classes containing such helper methods.
The class {@link umontreal.iro.lecuyer.xmlbind.ParamReadHelper}
provides methods for maps of properties,
random variate generators, and
database connections.
The class {@link umontreal.iro.lecuyer.xmlbind.ArrayConverter}
provides helper methods for 2D arrays of various common types.
It also defines an abstract converter class,
{@link umontreal.iro.lecuyer.xmlbind.JAXBParamsConverter},
which encapsulates a JAXB context
and mechanisms to read and write XML files with validation
using a Schema.
See the documentation of package {@link javax.xml.bind},
in the Java API specification, for more information
about JAXB.
