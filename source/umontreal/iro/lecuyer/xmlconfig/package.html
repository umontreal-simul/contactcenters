Provides some facilities to extract and verify parameters read from
data files in XML format.
Parameter reading is often tedious and clutters the application code with
repetitive statements.  Read parameters must be converted
from string to useful types, checked for validity and processed
in many ways before they can be used by an application
program.
By using XML \cite{iYER04a}, one can take advantage of a standardized
file format syntax and already implemented and robust
parsers providing error checking.  However, even when
a validating parser, which is able to ensure that an XML file satisfy
predefined structural constraints, is used,
the parameters must be extracted from a parse tree and converted
from string.

This package provides facilities to extract and convert values
from a Document Object Model (DOM) document constructed using
the Java API for XML (JAXP) or any other API implementing
DOM Level 2 \cite{iHOR00a}
or above.  It uses a design-patterns oriented
technique strongly inspired from Apache Ant \cite{iBAI04} task building but
extended to be used in a more general context.

\subsubsection*{Format of parameter files}

This section briefly introduces the XML format as used by the
parameter files.  See \cite{iYER04a} for the full XML specification.
The first line of an XML file is optional and contains an header
specifying the version of the format and the encoding.  This line is
like the following one:
\begin{verbatim}
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="iso-8859-1"?>
\end{verbatim}
If this line is not given, the UTF-8 character encoding is assumed.
Specifying the encoding can be useful to allow accented characters to
appear in the input when the used editor does not support UTF-8.

In an XML file, an \emph{element} is a container with a name
and possibly some attributes.  It is represented by a starting marker
and an ending marker.  The text between these markers is called the
\emph{contents} of the element.  For example,
\verb!<element>contents</element>! declares an element with name
\texttt{element} and contents \texttt{contents}.  An element with no
contents can be formatted as \verb!<element/>!.  This is called a
\emph{self-closing element}.  The whole XML document is contained into
a special element called the \emph{root element}.

An \emph{attribute} is a key-value pair associated with an element.
An element can have zero or more attributes.  For example,
\verb!<element attribute="value"/>! declares a self-closing element
\texttt{element} with attribute \texttt{attribute} having value
\texttt{value}.  The order of an element's attributes is not important
in any XML document.

The nested contents can be simple or complex.  \emph{Simple contents} is
composed of only \emph{character data}, i.e., text with no XML
markers.  If such characters are required for some reasons, they must
be escaped by using \emph{entities}.  Entities are sequences of
characters automatically substituted with character data
by an XML parser.  For the user, they act similarly to macros.
Table~\ref{tab:entities} shows the entities
used to escape reserved characters.

\begin{table}[htb]
\caption{XML entities used to escape reserved characters}
\label{tab:entities}
  \centering
  \begin{tabular}{|lr|}
    \hline
    Entity\html{$\mbox{}$}&Escaped character\\\hline
    \texttt{\&lt;}&\verb!<!\\
    \texttt{\&gt;}&\verb!>!\\
    \texttt{\&quot;}&\texttt{"}\\
%"  For GNU Emacs to be happy
    \texttt{\&amp;}&\texttt{\&}\\\hline
  \end{tabular}
\end{table}

\emph{Complex contents} is composed of character data and
other elements.  Some XML document types specify an order in which the
elements need to be presented.  For the parameter reader, the order of
elements is not important.

At any point in the XML file, \emph{comments} of the form
\verb?<!-- comment -->? can be added.  These comments are ignored by
the parameter reader and can be used to document the parameter files.

\emph{Processing instructions} can be used to communicate with
specific XML processors.  The parameter reading facility implemented
in this package supports the \texttt{import} processing instruction
which can be used to import packages when referring to class names in
parameter files.  The \texttt{import} processing instruction works the
same way as the Java \texttt{import} statement.  For example,
\verb!<?import java.util.*?>! imports all classes in the
{@link java.util} package.

\subsubsection*{Extracting parameters}

For an XML document to be converted into a parameter object,
an instance of {@link umontreal.iro.lecuyer.xmlconfig.ParamReader}
is needed.  The root element name must be bound to a parameter object class,
by modifying the \texttt{elements} map.  For example, the following code
associates the
\texttt{myparams} root element with the class \texttt{MyParams}.

\begin{verbatim}

   ParamReader reader = new ParamReader();
   reader.elements.put ("myparams", MyParams.class);
\end{verbatim}

After the binding is done, the reading method can be invoked.
The \texttt{read} method accepts a {@link org.w3c.dom.Document}
implementation or an XML file name and turns it into
a parameter object.  In the preceding example, the general format
of the XML file would be

\begin{verbatim}

   <myparams>
      ...
   </myparams>
\end{verbatim}

The following call would read the XML file and creates a \texttt{MyParams} instance.

\begin{verbatim}

   MyParams par = (MyParams)reader.read ("file.xml");
\end{verbatim}

\subsubsection*{Converting back to XML}

To be converted back to XML, a parameter object needs to provide a
write method specified in the {@link
umontreal.iro.lecuyer.xmlconfig.StorableParam} interface.  This method
turns the parameter object into a DOM document.  The DOM document can
then be converted to an XML file.  The {@link
umontreal.iro.lecuyer.xmlconfig.AbstractParam} class provides a
\texttt{write} method capable of converting the storable parameter
object to an XML file.

For example, if \texttt{MyParams} implements
{@link umontreal.iro.lecuyer.xmlconfig.StorableParam},
the following code can write the parameter object \texttt{par} to an XML file.

\begin{verbatim}

   AbstractParam.write (new ClassFinder(), "file.xml",
                        par, "myparams", 3);
\end{verbatim}

The class finder is used to convert {@link java.lang.Class} objects to simple
class names, taking the import declarations into account.  The name of
the root element, \texttt{myparams}, must be given, as well as the
number of spaces for each indentation level.

\subsubsection*{Creating new parameter object classes}

A parameter object can come from any class implementing
the {@link umontreal.iro.lecuyer.xmlconfig.Param} interface, providing
a no-argument constructor, and supplying setter, adder, or creater methods
that will be mapped to XML attributes and nested elements.
\emph{Setter} methods are used to notify the parameter object
about the value of attributes whereas \emph{adder} and \emph{creater} methods
are used to notify nested elements.

For attribute \emph{attr}, the setter method \texttt{set}\emph{Attr}
is called and the string contents of the attribute is converted to the
target class by {@link umontreal.iro.lecuyer.util.StringConvert}.
The \texttt{id} attribute has a special meaning for the
parameter reader; it assigns a name to an element.
When the \texttt{xref} attribute is associated with an element, the
element's contents is expected to be empty and the only allowed
attribute is \texttt{xref}.  The parameter reader replaces such a
reference element's attributes and contents with the element having
the matching \texttt{id} attribute.

Nested XML elements are
recursively turned into parameter objects by adder and creater methods.
An adder method has the form \texttt{add}\emph{Element} whereas a
creater method has the form \texttt{create}\emph{Element}.
For simple contents, the adder method can accept a class that can be
converted by {@link umontreal.iro.lecuyer.util.StringConvert}.
For complex contents to be represented, another parameter object must
be used.

For a parameter object to become storable, it must implement the
{@link umontreal.iro.lecuyer.xmlconfig.StorableParam} subinterface of
{@link umontreal.iro.lecuyer.xmlconfig.Param}.  This interface
specifies a writing method responsible for the conversion.  The {@link
umontreal.iro.lecuyer.xmlconfig.DOMUtils} class contains helper
methods that can be used during the conversion of any parameter object
to a DOM tree.

\paragraph{Example of a parameter file.} The following
example shows how the parameters from a sample
file are handled and converted.

\begin{verbatim}

<?xml version="1.0"?>

<myparams id="test">
   <numtypes>3</numtypes>
   <numgroups>2</numgroups>
   <arrivalrates>2, 4, 2</arrivalrates>
</myparams>
\end{verbatim}

We define a class \texttt{MyParams} implementing
{@link umontreal.iro.lecuyer.xmlconfig.Param} and
providing a no-argument
constructor and the following methods.
The methods do not need to be public.

\begin{verbatim}

   class MyParams implements Param {
      void setId (String id) { ... }
      void addNumtypes (int n) { ... }
      void addNumgroups (int n) { ... }
      ArrayParam createArrivalrates() {
         return new ArrayParam (double.class);
      }
      addArrivalrates (ArrayParam rates) { r = rates.getDoubleValues(); }
   }
\end{verbatim}

After the parameter object is constructed, the parameter reader
calls \texttt{setId} with the string \texttt{test}.
All other attributes are mapped to a corresponding setter method.

The parameter reader then calls \texttt{addNumtypes} with integer
\texttt{3}.
The same process happens for the \texttt{numgroups} nested
element.

When the \texttt{arrivalrates} element is found, the
\texttt{createArrivalrates} method is called to create a parameter
object.  This creater method is necessary because the {@link
umontreal.iro.lecuyer.xmlconfig.ArrayParam} class does not provide a
no-argument constructor since the user needs to specify the component
class for
the array.  The parameter reader constructs the array parameter object
and pass it back to \texttt{addArrivalrates} when the configuration is
done.  The \texttt{getDoubleValues} method can be used to get an array
of double-precision elements when the array component class is
numeric.  Note that there is a similar class for 2D arrays called
{@link umontreal.iro.lecuyer.xmlconfig.ArrayParam2D}.
