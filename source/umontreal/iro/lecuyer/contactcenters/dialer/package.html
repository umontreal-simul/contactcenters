Manages a predictive dialer capable of making outbound contacts.
A \emph{predictive dialer} is normally used to generate outbound calls.
The dialer's policy determines the number of calls to try on each occasion,
and supplies a list to extract them from.
Each extracted contact is then tested for success or failure.
The dialer defines separate lists of new-contact listeners for right
party connects, and
failed calls.

This package provides the
{@link umontreal.iro.lecuyer.contactcenters.dialer.Dialer}
representing the predictive dialer.
Any dialing policy is an implementation of the interface
{@link umontreal.iro.lecuyer.contactcenters.dialer.DialerPolicy}
and dialer lists are represented by
{@link umontreal.iro.lecuyer.contactcenters.dialer.DialerList}
objects.
The package provides implementations of dialer lists as well as
commonly used dialing policies.
