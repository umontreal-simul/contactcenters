Provides facilities to predict the waiting time of contacts.
This package defines an interface,
{@link
umontreal.iro.lecuyer.contactcenters.expdelay.WaitingTimePredictor},
representing a waiting-time predictor.
Before a predictor can be used, it must be registered with a router.
This registration allows the predictor to register any observer
necessary to track system's state.
A prediction can be obtained for any contact, whether it is
newly-arrived, or is already waiting in a queue.
