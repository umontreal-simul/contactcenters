Manages waiting queues for storing contacts not being
served immediately.
A waiting queue
represents a data structure organizing
waiting contacts while supporting abandonment.
Three types of data structures are available for waiting queues, each
implemented in concrete subclasses of
{@link umontreal.iro.lecuyer.contactcenters.queue.WaitingQueue}:
a list, a sorted set, or a heap.

The {@link umontreal.iro.lecuyer.contactcenters.queue.StandardWaitingQueue}
uses a {@link java.util.List}
for First In First Out (FIFO)
or Last In First Out (LIFO) queues.  Queued contacts are ordered
based on their arrival times, and can be easily
enumerated.
When the number of priorities is
finite and small, priority queues can be implemented efficiently by
combining several standard waiting queues.

General priority queues are implemented by
{@link umontreal.iro.lecuyer.contactcenters.queue.QueueWaitingQueue},
which uses a heap implemented by
the {@link java.util.Queue} interface.
By default, contacts are ordered using
their arrival times and their priorities,
but the user may supply its
own {@link java.util.Comparator}
to change this order.
Heaps are very efficient for inserting
new contacts or
removing the first contact,
but queued contacts are
not enumerated
in any particular order.

The most generic waiting queue,
{@link umontreal.iro.lecuyer.contactcenters.queue.PriorityWaitingQueue},
uses a {@link java.util.SortedSet}
to store contacts. As with the heap-based
queue, the user can supply its own
{@link java.util.Comparator} to order
contacts.
Contacts are also enumerated in the
order defined by the comparator used.
However, the operations on
the sorted set are slower
than the operations on a list
or a heap.

This package also provides support classes to obtain maximal queue
times and to compute the integral of the queue size over simulation
time.
