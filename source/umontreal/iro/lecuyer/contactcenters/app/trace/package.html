Provides facilities for creating contact-by-contact traces in simulators.
For debugging or computing custom statistics such as quantiles,
obtaining a trace of every contact generated by a simulator can be
useful.
This package provides some classes to collect the relevant information
about contacts, and store it into a file or database.

The tracing facility is represented by an object implementing the
interface
{@link umontreal.iro.lecuyer.contactcenters.app.trace.ContactTrace}.
Implementations of this interface are available for traces in text
files, Excel spreadsheets, or any database for which a JDBC driver is
available.
The
{@link umontreal.iro.lecuyer.contactcenters.app.trace.FileContactTrace}
class provides a static convenience method for creating the call trace
object from parameters read from an XML file.

To use this facility, a simulator simply needs to create an instance
of a class implementing
\texttt{ContactTrace}, and
call
the \texttt{writeLine} method for every contact.
Usually, this is done in an exited-contact listener.
