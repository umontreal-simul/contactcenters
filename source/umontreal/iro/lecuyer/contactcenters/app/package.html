Provides an interface for application programs interacting with a
contact center simulator or evaluation system.
The ContactCenters library can be used to create simulators modeling
complex contact centers.  These simulators may be accessed from
other programs, e.g., for optimization or statistical analysis.
Programs may also use analytical
formulas to get approximations of some performance measures, for more
efficiency
or for comparing with simulation.  This package defines an abstract
interface permitting such programs to get their data in a standardized
way.  Package {@link umontreal.iro.lecuyer.contactcenters.msk}
provides a generic simulator implementing this interface.

The defined interface, {@link
umontreal.iro.lecuyer.contactcenters.app.ContactCenterEval},
represents a system capable of performing
evaluations for a contact center.
We define an \emph{evaluation} as a process using
user-specified parameters to estimate some performance measures with
analytical formulas or simulation.
The interface provides a standardized mechanism
to run evaluations, and obtain estimates of
performance measures.
It also supports evaluation options, i.e., parameters that can be
changed independently of the specific implementation.

The {@link umontreal.iro.lecuyer.contactcenters.app.ContactCenterSim}
extends the {@link
umontreal.iro.lecuyer.contactcenters.app.ContactCenterEval} interface
with methods for obtaining the variance, the minimum, the maximum, and
computing confidence intervals.
These statistics are available only when performing several
replications of a simulation, or when dividing a simulation into
batches.

This package also provides an enumerated type, {@link
umontreal.iro.lecuyer.contactcenters.app.PerformanceMeasureType}, that
represents the type of a performance measure.
An element of this enum can be used as a key to several methods in
this package, or queried for information such as a name, the type of
estimation, etc.
Facilities are also provided to format matrices containing estimates
of performance measures of a given type.

This package also defines some commonly-used parameter objects for
storing parameters for simulation experiments, and the values of
thresholds for computing service levels.
