<body>
Defines an interface for representing a condition on calls, and
provides some implementations of the interface.
A condition is an object that can be checked against any call of
the model.  When the condition is verified for a given call, we say
that it applies for this call.
Alternatively, some conditions may not depend on a call and rather
checks the global state of the system.
Conditions can be used to affect the behavior of routing or dialing
policies.

The package provides the {@link
umontreal.iro.lecuyer.contactcenters.msk.conditions.Condition}
interface to represent a condition.
The other classes provide implementations of this interface for, e.g.,
conditions on the queue sizes, the number of free agents in group,
etc.
The class
{@link
umontreal.iro.lecuyer.contactcenters.msk.conditions.ConditionUtil}
is also provided to help with the
creation of condition objects from
{@link
umontreal.iro.lecuyer.contactcenters.msk.params.ConditionParams}
instances created by parsing XML configuration files.
