Service provider interfaces for creating custom arrival processes,
router's or dialer's policies.
When one of these interfaces are implemented, the implementation
is registered using the appropriate static method, or
packaged as a Java extension with information for the
service loading API.
See {@link java.util.ServiceLoader} for more information on this.
