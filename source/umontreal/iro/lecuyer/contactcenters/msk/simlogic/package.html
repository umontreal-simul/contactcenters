Provides classes implementing the logic
containing the necessary instructions
to simulate a model of a call
center, and interact with facilities
for statistical collecting.
Such a logic can simulate independent replications
using a given model, or split a single long replication
into time intervals. In both cases, the simulation can
be divided into steps corresponding to either replication,
either time intervals also called batches.

To perform an experiment, a simulation logic is first
initialized, which resets the
state of its associated
model to an empty system.
The logic can then be used to simulate a certain number of steps.
 
The simulation logic interacts with the statistical
collecting facilities in the following ways.
First, any simulation can
provide a period index for each observed call.
This period index often corresponds to the period of arrival of the call,
but it can also be the period at which the service ends,
a fixed value (for simulations with batch means), etc.
A simulation logic makes matrices of counters available for
statistical collectors.
When such a matrix is required, the logic may perform
some processing such as aggregating columns or
normalizing values with respect to time.
After each step, the simulation logic adds observations
to statistical collectors.

The simulation logic is represented by an object implementing the
{@link umontreal.iro.lecuyer.contactcenters.msk.simlogic.SimLogic} interface
which inherits interfaces in the package
{@link umontreal.iro.lecuyer.contactcenters.msk.stat}
for interaction with statistical collecting facilities.
This package provides two implementations of this interface:
{@link umontreal.iro.lecuyer.contactcenters.msk.simlogic.RepLogic}
for simulating independent replications, and
{@link umontreal.iro.lecuyer.contactcenters.msk.simlogic.BatchMeansLogic}
for simulations with batch means of a single period as if it was
infinite in the model.

Moreover, an object implementing the
{@link umontreal.iro.lecuyer.contactcenters.msk.simlogic.SimLogicListener} interface
can be registered with a simulation logic and used to monitor the
simulated steps.
The
{@link umontreal.iro.lecuyer.contactcenters.msk.simlogic.SimLogicBase}
class
also provides some support methods for simulation logics.
