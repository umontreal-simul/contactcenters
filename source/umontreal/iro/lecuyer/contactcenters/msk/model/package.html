Provides the classes that implement the model of a call center with multiple
call types and agent groups used by the blend and multi-skill simulator.
The implemented model contains several elements:
random streams for each type of random variate,
factories for creating objects representing calls,
arrival processes for generating the arrival times of inbound calls,
dialers for producing outbound calls,
agent groups, waiting queues, and a router.
The parameters of the model are obtained using XML
files transformed by JAXB into intermediate objects
regrouped in an instance of the
{@link umontreal.iro.lecuyer.contactcenters.msk.params.CallCenterParams} class.
The class
{@link umontreal.iro.lecuyer.contactcenters.msk.CallCenterParamsConverter}
can be used to help in the conversion of XML data to an instance of
{@link umontreal.iro.lecuyer.contactcenters.msk.params.CallCenterParams}.
The parameter objects are used to create the model, which
provides methods to access parameters
in a convenient way.

Arrival processes, dialers, agent groups, and
the router are encapsulated in manager
objects playing several roles:
provide convenience methods for accessing
parameters specific to the managed object,
create the appropriate instance for
the managed object,
initialize it at the beginning
of a simulation, and
update its state throughout the simulation.
All these manager objects can be accessed using
methods in the
{@link umontreal.iro.lecuyer.contactcenters.msk.model.CallCenter}
class, which is the
central point of the model.

The model is usually created by the
{@link umontreal.iro.lecuyer.contactcenters.msk.CallCenterSim}
class, and can be retrieved by its
\texttt{get\-Call\-Center} method.
However, one may create a \texttt{CallCenter}
object directly, and use it to get some information
about the represented call center (e.g., mean service times),
or perform custom
simulations.
