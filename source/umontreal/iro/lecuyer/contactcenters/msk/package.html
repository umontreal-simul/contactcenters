Provides a generic simulator for multi-skill and blend call centers.
ContactCenters can be used directly to construct simulators for
arbitrarily complex contact centers.  See the \texttt{examples.pdf}
document for examples of this.  However, this requires programming
and the resulting programs can become complex.
This package provides a generic simulator adapted for call centers
with multiple call types and agent groups, and using XML configuration files.
It can be
used for many simulation scenarios, and estimates a large set of
performance measures.

This reference documentation covers all classes and methods in the simulator.
It is targeted at developers who are using the tool in a program,
or extending it.
See the \texttt{guidemsk.pdf} document for a description of the model
implemented by this simulator, and examples showing how
to configure and use the tool from a user perspective.

The simulator
implemented in this package is split into several components representing the model, the
simulation logic, and the system managing statistics.  The model
regroups every entity of the call center, e.g., calls, agent groups,
waiting queues, routers, etc.  
It also specifies how random numbers are generated throughout the simulation.

The simulation logic contains the necessary instructions to run the
model in order to generate results.
It defines the concept of a \emph{step} and assigns
\emph{statistical periods} to calls.
For a simulation with independent replications, each
step corresponds to a replication while the statistical period
is usually the period of arrival.
For a simulation of a single period as it was infinite in the model,
steps correspond to time intervals of a single long replication,
and the statistical period is always 0.

The system managing statistics, on the other hand, is made of observers, and matrices of counters.
Observers are registered to collect information about every call
leaving the system, and the evolution of
agent groups and waiting queues.
All this information is used to update matrices of counters whose
rows usually correspond to call types
or agent groups, and columns, to periods.
At the end of each simulation step, the values of the counters are
added to matching matrices of statistical collectors.
After the simulation is done, matrices of averages, sample variances, and other statistics
can be obtained.

Figure~\ref{fig:umlgensim}
shows a UML diagram of the simulator's main classes.
The model is implemented by classes in package
{@link umontreal.iro.lecuyer.contactcenters.msk.model},
\texttt{CallCenter} being the main class.
The simulation logics are implemented in package
{@link umontreal.iro.lecuyer.contactcenters.msk.simlogic}
with the \texttt{SimLogic} interface representing any simulation logic.
The management of statistics is in package
{@link umontreal.iro.lecuyer.contactcenters.msk.stat}.
Matrices of counters are encapsulated in an object of
\texttt{Call\-Center\-Measure\-Manager}, while
matrices of statistical probes are stored in  an instance of
a class implementing the \texttt{Call\-Center\-Stat\-Probes}.
See the documentation of these packages for more information about
these components and the classes.

The simulator provides three packages in addition to the packages
providing the implementation for the main components.
The package
{@link umontreal.iro.lecuyer.contactcenters.msk.cv}
provides an implementation of control variates to reduce the variance
in simulations.
The package
{@link umontreal.iro.lecuyer.contactcenters.msk.spi}
provides interfaces used when integrating a custom arrival
process, routing or dialing policy into the simulator.
The package
{@link umontreal.iro.lecuyer.contactcenters.msk.conditions}
implement conditions that can be used by some
routing and dialing policies.

The class {@link
umontreal.iro.lecuyer.contactcenters.msk.CallCenterSim}
represents the simulator as a whole, and implements the interface
{@link umontreal.iro.lecuyer.contactcenters.app.ContactCenterSim}, which
provides methods to perform simulations and obtain statistics in a standardized way.
It provides a main method that can be used to call the simulator from the command
line. The simulator can also be called from Java code.
% In the future, some other simulators will be provided
% or the current simulators will be extended
% for contacts other than calls, e.g., fax and e-mail which
% require preemption.
