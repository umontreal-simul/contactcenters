Provides utility classes to manage statistics in the blend/multi-skill
call center simulator.
The system for managing statistics is split into two parts:
counters updated throughout the simulation, and
collectors updated only at the end of steps using the values of
counters.
Counters and collectors are regrouped into matrices whose rows
correspond to call types, agent groups, or (call type, agent group)
pairs, and
columns represent time intervals.
We now examine how counters and collectors are managed
and interact
in more details.

The abstract class
{@link umontreal.iro.lecuyer.contactcenters.msk.stat.CallCenterMeasureManager}
represents the matrices of counters.  It can be used to list the supported types of measures, and
return matrices of values for any supported type.
Getting a matrix of values is done by reading the
corresponding counters, and performing some
computations such as regrouping periods or
normalizing with respect to time.
The exact computation depends on application and thus
on the concrete subclass.
Usually, the matrices of counters contain one column per period,
and matrices of statistical collectors have one column per main period,
plus an extra column representing the whole horizon.

The measure manager also encapsulates
some observers linked to the
call center model in order to collect the appropriate
statistics.
These observers use an instance of
{@link umontreal.iro.lecuyer.contactcenters.msk.stat.StatPeriod}
to obtain the statistical period of any processed call.
The call center measure manager also includes an
instance of
{@link umontreal.iro.lecuyer.contactcenters.msk.stat.CallByCallMeasureManager},
which
regroups every counter containing sums with one (possibly 0) term for each
simulated call.

On the other hand,
the interface
{@link
umontreal.iro.lecuyer.contactcenters.msk.stat.CallCenterStatProbes}
represents a set of matrices of statistical collectors.
The most common implementation of this interface is
{@link
umontreal.iro.lecuyer.contactcenters.msk.stat.SimCallCenterStat}
which provides a method \texttt{addObs} to add matrices of counters, obtained
using an instance of
{@link
umontreal.iro.lecuyer.contactcenters.msk.stat.CallCenterMeasureManager}, to
the corresponding matrices of collectors.
Other implementations of the interface can be used
to collect statistics about statistics, e.g., averages of averages,
variances, etc., combine the information given by two
instances of
{@link
umontreal.iro.lecuyer.contactcenters.msk.stat.SimCallCenterStat}, etc.
This can be used to apply some variance reduction techniques
such as stratification and randomized quasi-Monte Carlo methods.
