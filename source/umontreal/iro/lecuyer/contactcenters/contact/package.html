Manages contact arrivals into the contact center system.
Any \emph{contact} traveling in the system is represented by an object from
the
{@link umontreal.iro.lecuyer.contactcenters.contact.Contact}
class being defined in this package.
This class defines a number of attributes associated with all
contacts, and the user can add custom attributes by defining a subclass.

Although an object representing a
contact can be freely instantiated, it is usually constructed by
a \emph{contact source}.  Two types of contact sources are available:
\emph{contact arrival processes} provided by this package, and \emph{dialers}
supported by the {@link umontreal.iro.lecuyer.contactcenters.dialer}
package.
Arrival processes determine when contact objects need to be created,
according to specific (stochastic) arrival processes.
Each concrete arrival process must correspond to an 
algorithm for generating inter-arrival times. 
These times could depend on the entire state of the system in a complicated way,
but they often depend only on the simulation time and
previous inter-arrival times.
For each process, the first arrival is  scheduled when the arrival process is 
started, often at the beginning of the simulation.
Figure~\ref{fig:umlContacts} gives a UML diagram for this contact
creation facility.

The \emph{factory} design pattern is used to allow the sources to construct
contacts without knowing their types explicitly.
The {@link umontreal.iro.lecuyer.contactcenters.contact.ContactFactory}
interface specifies a method  called
\texttt{new\-Instance} returning a newly-constructed and configured
contact object.  A contact source can create contacts from any class that 
implements this interface simply by invoking this \texttt{new\-Instance} method.
Thus, changing the type of contact (and the name of its explicit constructor)
requires no change to the implementation of the contact source.

When a new contact occurs, it is instantiated by the associated factory and 
broadcast to the registered \emph{new-contact listeners}.
Then the next arrival is scheduled.  
Each contact source is assigned a factory that typically constructs
contacts of a single type.  All contact sources can be
initialized, started, and stopped.
