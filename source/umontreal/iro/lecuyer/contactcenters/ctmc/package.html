Provides call center simulators based
on a quick uniformized continuous-time Markov chain model.
Staffing and scheduling optimization in large multiskill call centers 
is time-consuming, mainly because it requires 
lengthy simulations to evaluate performance measures and their 
sensitivity.  Simplified models that provide tractable formulas are 
unrealistic in general.  This package implements an intermediate 
solution, based on an approximate continuous-time Markov chain model
of the call center.  This model is more accurate than the commonly used 
approximations, and yet can be simulated faster than a more realistic
simulation (based on non-exponential distributions and additional details).  
To speed up the simulation, the Markov chain is uniformized and 
only its discrete-time version is simulated.
Performance measures such as the fraction of calls of
each type answered within a given waiting time limit can be recovered from
this simulation.

The CTMC model supports multiple call types and agent groups, but
it assumes that calls arrive following a Poisson process, and
service and patience times are exponential.
For more information about the model, see \cite{ccBUI08a}.

The main class for the simulator is 
{@link
umontreal.iro.lecuyer.contactcenters.ctmc.BasicCallCenterCTMCSimMP}.
It can simulate a call center with multiple periods by using one CTMC
for each period.
The
{@link
umontreal.iro.lecuyer.contactcenters.ctmc.BasicCallCenterCTMCSim}
class, on the other hand, provides a simulator for a single period,
using a single CTMC.
Both simulators first generate the total number of transitions from
the Poisson distribution, followed by the transitions.
However,
the
{@link
umontreal.iro.lecuyer.contactcenters.ctmc.IntMCallCenterCTMCSim}
class implements a single-period simulator generating a large number of transitions
and integrating over the number of transitions using Poisson
probabilities when estimating performance measures.

All these simulators use CTMC models represented by the interface
{@link
umontreal.iro.lecuyer.contactcenters.ctmc.IntMCallCenterCTMCSim}.
The package provides two different implementations for this interface:
one adapted for a single call type and agent group using linear
search, and another one for multiple call types and agent groups based
on indexed search.
