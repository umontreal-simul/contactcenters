Contains the contact routing facilities.
A \emph{router}, called an \emph{automatic call distributor} (ACD) for call centers,
can be any class listening to new contacts, and
assigning them to agent groups or adding them to waiting
queues.  The router listens to service terminations to assign queued
contacts to free agents and to waiting queue events for statistical
collection and overflow support.

This package provides the {@link
umontreal.iro.lecuyer.contactcenters.router.Router}
base class as a basis to implement routers using almost arbitrary policy.
It can listen to new contacts and interact with waiting queues and
agent groups, which makes it a central point in any contact center.
For contacts to be counted correctly during statistical collection,
an \emph{exited-contact listener} can also be registered
with a router which knows exactly when contacts abandon,
are blocked, and are served.
Figure~\ref{fig:umlRouting} gives a UML diagram summarizing how the
router is connected to the other parts of the system.

\label{fig:umlRouting}

The routing policy itself must be implemented in a subclass by defining fields
for the data and implementing or overriding methods for the routing logic.
The router needs schemes for agent and contact selections, and
it can optionally clear waiting queues when the contact center
does not have idle or busy agents capable of serving the waiting contacts.
Algorithms to process dequeued and served contacts may also be needed
in complex systems supporting overflow or service by multiple agents.

This package provides a few predefined policies inspired
from \cite{ccWHI04a} and \cite{ccKOO03a}.
These policies do not cover all possible scenarios, but new policies
can easily be added.

A first class of policies uses ordered lists as follows.
For each contact type~$k$, the \emph{type-to-group map} defines an
ordered list $i_{k, 0}, i_{k, 1}, \ldots$ of agent groups.  For each
agent group~$i$, the \emph{group-to-type map} defines an ordered list
$k_{i, 0}, k_{i, 1}, \ldots$ of contact types.
These lists indicate which agent groups
can serve a contact of type~$k$ and which contact types can be served
by agents in group~$i$, respectively.  The order of the elements can
be used to define priorities.
This data structure prevents contact types or agent groups
from sharing the same priority, and
may produce inconsistent routing policies.  For example, a bad router
could assign new contacts of type~$k$ to agents in group~$i$ without
pulling contacts of type~$k$ from queues when an agent in group~$i$
becomes free.  Checker methods are provided in
{@link umontreal.iro.lecuyer.contactcenters.router.RoutingTableUtils}
to detect this problem,
but they need to linearly scan the routing tables.  As a result, they
must be manually called by the user to avoid decreasing the
performance.

In a second type of policy, \emph{matrices of ranks} assign ranks or priorities
$\rTG(k, i)$ and
$\rGT(i, k)$ to contacts of type~$k$ served by agents in group~$i$.
If the rank is $\infty$, i.e., {@link java.lang.Double#POSITIVE_INFINITY},
contacts of type~$k$ cannot be served by
agents in group~$i$.  Otherwise, the smaller is the rank,
the higher is the priority of contacts of type~$k$ for
agents in group~$i$.  The matrix defining $\rTG(k, i)$ specifies how
contacts prefer agents, and is used for agent selection.
The second matrix, defining $\rGT(i, k)$, specifies how agents prefer
contacts, and is used for contact selection.
In many cases, it is possible to have $\rGT(i, k)=\rTG(k, i)$ and
specify a single matrix of ranks.
This structure allows equal priorities to exist,
but routing policies are more complex.  When ranks are equal, a
secondary algorithm must be used for tie breaking, reducing the
performance of the simulator.

The package also supports
the \emph{incidence matrix}, which assigns a boolean value $m(i, k)$
for each contact types and agent groups.  $m(i, k)$ is \emph{true} if
and only if contacts of type~$k$ can be served
by agents in group~$i$.  Such a matrix is not used for
routing because it does not encode any priority, but the package
provides methods to convert it to a type-to-group, group-to-type, or
matrix of ranks.

The package also provides some helper classes and methods
to ease the implementation of routers with complex
routing policies.  These methods can test the consistency of routing
information data structures, and perform conversions from one
structure to another.  They can also help in contact and agent
selections.
