Manages the simulation of the contact's service process.
The purpose of the contact center is to offer some service which
is provided by a pool of servers or agents sharing the same skills.

An \emph{agent group}~$i$, represented by an instance of
{@link umontreal.iro.lecuyer.contactcenters.server.AgentGroup},
contains $N_i(t)\in\NN$ members at simulation time~$t$.
Among these agents, $\Ni[i](t)$ are idle, and $\Nb[i](t)$  are
busy.
Only $\Nf[i](t)\le\Ni[i](t)$ agents are available to serve new contacts.

The service of a contact is divided in two steps.
After communicating with a customer (first step), an agent can perform
after-contact work (second step), e.g., update an account, take some notes, etc.
After the first step, the contact may exit the system, or be
transferred to another agent.  However, the agent becomes free only
after the second step (if any) is over.

By default,  for better efficiency, an agent group does not contain an object
for each agent, preventing the simulator from differentiating them.
Individual agents can of course be simulated by creating groups
with a single member, but regrouping the agents can be useful for more
efficient routing.  The subclass
{@link umontreal.iro.lecuyer.contactcenters.server.DetailedAgentGroup} offers
an implementation where
each individual agent is a separate object with its own characteristics.
Each such agent can be added to or removed from a group at any time during a
simulation.

This package also provides helper classes to assign service times to
contacts and compute the integrals of the number of agents over
simulation time.
